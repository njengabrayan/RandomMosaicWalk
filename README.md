# RandomMosaicWalk
A simple java project I initiated to help me get hands'on on the git platform.

# ABOUT THE PROGRAM
  ![ screenshot image of the program](http://trendymosaic.com/Trendy-Mosaic-ScreenShots/TrendyMosaic-SC-Blend-3.jpg)
  - Java was the languaged used
  - The program opens a window full of randomly colored squares.
  - A 'disturbance' moves randomly in the window changing the color of each square that it visits.
  - THE PROGRAM WILL RUN UNTIL THE WINDOW IS CLOSED
 
 ## open to criticism and correction.
